            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>SINCE Monday the Seventh inſtant, when Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi> Senior Church-warden of <hi>Alhallows Barkin</hi> pleaded guilty at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>'s Indictment (which Mr.<note n="*" place="margin">And who is reported to be the man, who was impriſon'd firſt by the Mayor of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and then by an Order from the Houſe of Lords, for ſaying <hi>all the Biſhops were Papiſts except Four.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Whitaker</hi> had before indicted the <hi>Lord Biſhop of London</hi> for keeping his Courts in his own Name) many of the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners of <hi>Barkin,</hi> and others have complained to Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Barkin,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi>'s manner of proceeding upon that Indictment (in which the Doctor, Lecturer, and Church-wardens were equally indicted) as having gratified the enemies, and much offended, and ſcandalized the Friends of the Government, and the Church.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe complaints the Doctor, laſt Lord's day after Evening Sermon, called a <hi>Vestry,</hi> at which Nineteen of the Principal Perſons of the Pariſh all Veſtry-men did appear.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were ſet, and had heard the<note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ann.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>Edw. VI.</hi> c. 10.</note> Statute read, upon which the Indictment was grounded, the Doctor upon Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi>'s refuſal to be preſent at the Veſtry, made a report of his proceeding upon the whole matter, telling them that Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi> had acted therein not only without, but expreſly againſt his advice and conſent, he having told him the Night before he appeared at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> that he conceived it was their duty to conſult the Veſtry about the manner of proceeding upon that Indictment, and that their defence (in his opinion) was neceſſary, and eaſie; <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> becauſe other wiſe they ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſty's Chappels-royal, the Cathedrals, and Collegiate-Churches and Chappels, and moſt of the Pariſh-churches of this City and Kingdom ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the laſh of every factious and diſaffected perſon, upon the account of the Church-ornaments: And <hi>Eaſie,</hi> becauſe the Figure, for ſuffering of which they were Indicted, had not the ſhape of the Statue of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> nor was ever reputed the Image, or called by the Name of any Saint whatſoever, but as we could make it appear by the Teſtimony of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds yet living in the Pariſh, had been made, and ſet up <hi>(in the late times of uſurpation)</hi> upon the Clock, or Hand-dyal, between <hi>Time</hi> on one hand, and <hi>Death</hi> on the other (whoſe Figures are yet to be ſeen (and that when the Clock was ſet over the Organ about Six years ago, it was ſet as an ornament over the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> where it ſtood unobſerved by himſelf, and many of his Pariſhoners till the firſt report of the Indictment, when Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi> was Foreman of the Grand-Jury, the Seſſions before Mr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> did really indict it: <hi>He alſo added,</hi> that he then told Mr. <hi>Sherman,</hi> that they had time enough to conſult the Veſtry, and take joynt-meaſures, being not obliged to anſwer to the Indictment till the Seſſions in <hi>Eaſter-week.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding this advice, and entreaties uſed to Mr. <hi>Sherman</hi> not to appear at the private Seſſions occaſionally held the next day, that the privily took down the Figure commonly called the Angel (becauſe it had a Trumpet at his mouth, and had written on a label hanging upon his Breaſt, ARISE YE DEAD, AND COME TO JUDGMENT) conveighed it to the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> and there pleaded guilty to the Indictment, and after the Court

               <!-- PDF PAGE 22 -->was riſen would have given away the Figure, but that he was forbidden by the worthy Mr. <hi>Hunter</hi> the other Church-warden, who made it be brought back to the Church, from whence on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning laſt, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sherman,</hi> without the knowledge of the Doctor, or Mr. <hi>Hunter,</hi> privily took it away by a Porter, pretending that Mr. Sheriff <hi>Bethel</hi> had demanded it by virtue of an Order made by the Court for demoliſhing of it, although the Court upon his pleading Guilty on the one hand, and Mr. Sheriffs urging the deſtruction of it on the other, could not be prevailed with to make any ſuch Order, thinking the Indictment frivolous and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>After the Doctor had related theſe, and many other particulars, the Veſtry gave him their thanks for his care in this buſineſs, and for endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſrve the Peace, and good order of the Pariſh, and forthwith reſolved (nemine contradicente) <hi>that at was their opinion that Mr.</hi> Sherman <hi>upon the whole matter had acted arbitrarily and irregularly, and that he ought to have conſulted the</hi> Veſtry, <hi>and taken their directions how to proceed upon the Indictment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They alſo (as we are informent) declared that this Order was not intended to preclude them from proceeding further againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Sherman,</hi> as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhould be thought fit: And upon this occaſion exhorted one another to be very careful, and unanimous in the next Election of their <hi>Veſtry-men</hi> in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch as were Loyal and good Church-men into the vacant places, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome Knights, and many other Gentlemen of undoubted Loyalty, and adherence to the eſtabliſhed Proteſtant Religion, were mentioned as fit for that truſt.</p>
            <p>As the Miniſters and Church-Wardens of <hi>Barkin</hi> have been Indicted for ſuffering the Image of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, in the Pariſh-Church, as the Learned Indicter firſt pleaſed to call the foreſaid Figure: ſo if he can find colour for it in any old Statute, he may as juſtly Indict them again for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pagan Idols;</hi> for old Time may be preſented for <hi>Saturn,</hi> and Death for <hi>Mors,</hi> who with his brother <hi>Erebus</hi> every School Boy can inform the Grand — were famous Deities of old.</p>
            <p>And if he pleaſe to do ſo, he may add by the merit of the action to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reputation, which he hath got by preſenting the <hi>Angel;</hi> which after it had eſcaped the Sentence of deſtruction, which was hoped for from the Court upon ſuch a ſurprize, a Gentleman would have bought at the purchaſe of a Guiny to have ſet up in his own Pariſh-Church. I ſuppoſe that Gentleman feared not a ſecond Indictment, being either a good Lawyer himſelf, or as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard one of the beſt Lawyers of the Nation, I mean Mr. <hi>Recorder,</hi> reply to one of the Loyal Aldermen, who asked him by what Statute, that Figure produced in the Court, could be Indicted? <hi>By none that he knew.</hi> The ſame Honourable Alderman asked one, who pleaded hard againſt the harmleſs Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, what that writing was upon his Breaſt? ARISE YE DEAD AND COME TO JUDGMENT, ſaith he: <hi>Ay, that's it</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he) <hi>which, I fear, offends you, you cannot endure to be reminded of the Laſt Judgment, the thoughts of it, perhaps, are trouble ſome unto you:</hi> And when the ſame Gentleman ſtill perſiſted to have it Sentenced to the Flames, ſome remote Voices were heard to ſay, Let him have it to burn in his Kitchin. I have only one obſervation to add, That in the beginning of the Late Times the Pariſh of <hi>Barkin</hi> was firſt Pariſh, and Doctor <hi>Layfield</hi> late Miniſter of it, the firſt Miniſter of <hi>London,</hi> who was troubled upon the account of ſome little Images in the work of the Cover of the Font, which the Factious people of that time reproachfully called, <hi>The Gods of Barkin.</hi> God Almighty, who equally hates Sacriledge, and Idolatry, and Schiſm, and Sedition as much as other ſins, divert the <hi>Omen,</hi> and blaſt the deſigns of all thoſe on either hand that ſeek the deſtruction of this <hi>truly perſecuted</hi> Church. <hi>Amen.</hi>
